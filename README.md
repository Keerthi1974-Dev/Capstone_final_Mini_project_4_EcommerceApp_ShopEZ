## 📌 Problem Statement

Platforms like **Nykaa**, **Myntra**, and **Meesho** have transformed how women shop in India — delivering curated fashion, beauty, and lifestyle collections in one seamless experience. However, building and scaling such a platform comes with real engineering challenges:

- How do you keep the platform fast as traffic and product catalogue grow?
- How do you deploy new features — say, a new payment method or a wishlist — without taking the whole site down?
- How do you ensure each user's orders stay private while admins can see everything?
- How do you prevent someone from buying a product that's already sold out?

**ShopEZ** is built to answer these challenges. It is a dedicated women's shopping destination covering categories like **Sarees, Anarkali suits, Footwear, Handbags, Jewellery, Skincare, Summer wear, and Accessories**. Rather than a monolithic architecture that becomes harder to scale and maintain over time, ShopEZ uses a **microservices architecture** — each business domain (authentication, products, orders) is its own independently deployable and testable service.

The platform solves these real user and business problems:

- Women shoppers need a **curated, category-driven** experience tailored to fashion and lifestyle — not a cluttered generic marketplace
- Products must show **real-time stock status** — low stock triggers a warning badge; zero stock disables the Add to Cart button entirely
- Shoppers want a **wishlist** to save products they love before committing to a purchase
- The **checkout flow** must feel familiar and trustworthy, with multiple Indian payment options: UPI (PhonePe, GPay, Paytm), Credit/Debit Card (Visa, Mastercard, Rupay), Net Banking (SBI, HDFC, ICICI, Axis, Kotak, PNB, Bank of Baroda), and Cash on Delivery
- **Customers must only see their own orders** — a regular user trying to access another user's order is blocked with a `403 Forbidden`
- **Admins see all orders** across every customer and can update or delete them
- Admins need a dedicated panel to **add, edit, and delete products** with Cloudinary image uploads
- JWT sessions must silently renew — the **HTTP interceptor** catches any 401 response, refreshes the token transparently, and retries the original request without the user ever noticing

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

ShopEZ is composed of three backend microservices, one API Gateway, and an Angular frontend — all orchestrated via Docker Compose.

```
┌──────────────────────────────────────────────┐

         └─────────────▼────────────┘
                SQL Server (Port 1433)
```

The **Order Service** calls the **Product Service** internally over HTTP to validate products and fetch names, prices, and images when an order is placed.

## ✨ Features

### 🏠 Hero Banner and Product Listing

The product listing page opens with a full-width **hero banner** — *"Dress to Impress: Curated fashion for the modern Indian woman"* — displaying a live product count, number of categories (9), and the app's rating (★ 4.8). A skeleton shimmer card grid is shown while products load from the API.

### 🔍 Search with Live Autocomplete

Typing in the search bar instantly renders a **dropdown of up to 6 matching suggestions** showing each product's name and price. Selecting a suggestion populates the search box and filters the grid. Clicking anywhere outside dismisses the dropdown. The result count updates live.

### 🏷️ Category Filter Pills

Nine category pills filter the product grid by keyword-matching against the product's name and description fields:

| Category | Keywords matched |
|---|---|
| ✨ All | — (show everything) |
| 🥻 Sarees | saree, silk, chiffon, kanjivaram, georgette |
| 👗 Anarkali | anarkali, suit, ethnic dress, kurta, churidar |
| 👡 Footwear | sandal, heel, kolhapuri, flat, shoe, slipper |
| 👜 Handbags | bag, tote, handbag, potli, clutch, purse, satchel |
| 💍 Jewellery | choker, necklace, kundan, bracelet, jhumka, oxidised, pearl |
| 🧴 Skincare | sunscreen, spf, skin, cream, serum, moisturiser, tinted |
| ☀️ Summer | maxi, dress, floral, co-ord, cotton, tropical |
| 💎 Accessories | hair, clip, scarf, belt, watch |

### 📦 Stock Indicators

Every product card shows a live stock status:

| Stock Level | Badge | Add to Cart |
|---|---|---|
| More than 5 units | `25 in stock` in green | Enabled |
| 1 to 5 units | `🔥 Hot — Only 3 left!` in orange | Enabled |
| 0 units | `Sold Out` in grey | **Disabled** |

On the Product Details page, the quantity selector is also capped at available stock — you cannot increment beyond what is in stock.

### ❤️ Wishlist

Any product card has a heart button. Clicking it toggles the product into or out of the wishlist. The icon shows ❤️ when wishlisted and ♡ when not. Wishlist state is maintained in memory per session.

### 🛍️ Shopping Cart

- Add products from the product list (quick add) or from the product details page (with quantity selector)
- Adjust quantity with +/− buttons in the cart; removing an item while decrementing works too
- Remove items individually with a Remove button
- Live cart item count badge on the navbar cart icon updates in real time via RxJS BehaviorSubject
- Order summary sidebar shows per-item totals and the cart grand total

### 💳 Checkout — 3-Step Flow

A step indicator bar tracks progress. Completed steps show a ✓ tick. Each step validates before allowing the user to advance.

**Step 1 — Delivery Address**

Fields: Full Name, Phone (10-digit validation), Street Address, City, State, Pincode (6-digit validation). Inline error messages appear per failing field when the user presses Continue.

**Step 2 — Payment Method**

Four payment options:

| Option | Input required |
|---|---|
| 📱 UPI | UPI ID — validated for `@` format (e.g. `priya@oksbi`, `9876543210@paytm`) |
| 💳 Credit / Debit Card | Card number (auto-formatted with spaces, 16 digits), Name on card, Expiry MM/YY, CVV (masked) |
| 🏦 Net Banking | Bank selection grid: SBI, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, Axis Bank, Kotak Bank, PNB, Bank of Baroda |
| 💵 Cash on Delivery | No extra input needed |

**Step 3 — Review and Place Order**

Shows a full summary — delivery address and payment method — each with a "Change" button to jump back to that step. Clicking "Place Order" hits the Order Service API. A loading animation plays while the request is in-flight. On success, a 🎉 banner shows the Order ID and total amount, then auto-redirects to the orders page after 3 seconds. The cart is cleared on success.

Free delivery is applied on all orders. A 🔒 100% Secure Checkout badge is displayed throughout the checkout.

### 📋 Orders Page

Each order is shown as a collapsible card displaying Order ID, date/time, item count, total, and a ✓ Confirmed status badge. Clicking a card expands it to reveal:

- Product thumbnail images for all items in the order
- A table with product name, quantity, unit price, and line total
- A **visual delivery progress tracker** with four stages: Order Placed ✓ → Confirmed ✓ → Shipped (Pending) → Delivered (Pending)

Orders are shown newest first (reverse chronological). A "No orders yet" empty state with a "Browse Collection" link is shown for new accounts.

**Role-based order filtering is enforced on the backend:**
- A `User` calling `GET /api/orders` receives only their own orders (filtered by `UserId` from the JWT claim)
- An `Admin` calling `GET /api/orders` receives all orders
- A `User` calling `GET /api/orders/{id}` for another user's order receives `403 Forbidden`

### 🔐 Login and Register

**Register page:** Full Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password (must match — validated client-side), and an Account Type radio selector: 👤 Customer or 🛠 Admin. Duplicate emails return a `409 Conflict` with an error message.

**Login page:** Email and Password with a show/hide password toggle button. Inline field validation on touch. On success, the server returns a JWT access token (1-day expiry), a refresh token (7-day expiry), and the full user object — all stored in `localStorage`.

**Silent token refresh:** The HTTP Interceptor automatically catches any `401 Unauthorized` response from the API. It calls `/api/auth/refresh-token` with the stored refresh token, updates localStorage with the new tokens, and retries the original failed request — completely transparent to the user. Multiple simultaneous 401s are queued and replayed after a single refresh. If the refresh itself fails (expired or revoked), the user is logged out and redirected to login automatically.

**Logout:** Calls `/api/auth/logout` to null out the refresh token in the database (invalidating it server-side), clears all localStorage entries, and navigates to the login page.

### 🛠️ Admin Panel — Product Management

Accessible via `/admin/products`. Visible to Admin role users only. The "+ Add Product" button also appears inline in the product list grid for admins.

The panel shows all products in a table (image, name, category, price, stock) with a Delete button per row. An Add Product form toggled from the header collects:

- Product Name and Category (dropdown: Women / Men)
- Description (textarea)
- Price (₹) and Stock (number)
- Image: either **upload a file from PC** (sent as multipart/form-data → Cloudinary → auto-cropped 400×400, stored in the `ecommerce-shopez` Cloudinary folder, returns a secure URL) **or** paste a Cloudinary image URL directly. A live image preview is shown before submitting.

Inline success and error banners confirm each action.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Node.js 18+](https://nodejs.org/) — only needed for running the frontend locally without Docker
- [.NET 8 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) — only needed for running backend services locally without Docker

### Run with Docker Compose

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd EcommerceApp

docker-compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---|---|
| Frontend (Angular) | http://localhost:4200 |
| API Gateway | http://localhost:5000 |
| Auth Service | http://localhost:5003 |
| Product Service | http://localhost:5001 |
| Order Service | http://localhost:5002 |
| SQL Server | localhost:1433 |

### Configuration

Update `appsettings.json` in each service before running:

**AuthService**
```json
{
  "Jwt": {
    "Key": "your-secret-key-minimum-32-characters",
    "Issuer": "ShopEZ",
    "Audience": "ShopEZUsers"
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=sqlserver;Database=AuthDb;User Id=sa;Password=YourStrong@Pass123;"
  }
}
```

**ProductService** — also requires Cloudinary credentials:
```json
{
  "Cloudinary": {
    "CloudName": "your-cloud-name",
    "ApiKey": "your-api-key",
    "ApiSecret": "your-api-secret"
  },
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=sqlserver;Database=ProductDb;User Id=sa;Password=YourStrong@Pass123;"
  }
}
```

**OrderService**
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=sqlserver;Database=OrderDb;User Id=sa;Password=YourStrong@Pass123;"
  }
}
```

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

Each microservice has a dedicated xUnit test project.

```bash
dotnet test AuthService.Tests/
dotnet test ProductService.Tests/
dotnet test OrderService.Tests/
```

Test coverage across the three projects includes:

- `AuthControllerTests` — register, login, duplicate email conflict, refresh token, logout
- `JwtAuthServiceTests` — token generation with correct claims, BCrypt hashing, refresh token save and expiry
- `ProductsControllerTests` — all CRUD endpoints, admin-only access enforcement, invalid ID handling
- `ProductServiceImplTests` — business logic validation, not-found handling, stock edge cases
- `ProductRepositoryTests` — EF Core data access and query logic
- `OrdersControllerTests` — order creation, role-based list filtering, forbidden access for wrong user, admin update/delete
- `OrderServiceImplTests` — total calculation from ProductService data, quantity validation, inter-service HTTP call handling

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- **Persistent Wishlist** — save wishlist to the backend so it survives logout and page refresh
- **Real Payment Gateway** — integrate Razorpay or Stripe instead of the current simulated checkout
- **Order Status Pipeline** — real statuses flowing from Placed → Confirmed → Shipped → Out for Delivery → Delivered
- **Email Notifications** — order confirmation and shipping update emails via SMTP or SendGrid
- **Product Reviews and Ratings** — let customers rate and review products they have purchased
- **Server-Side Search and Pagination** — offload filtering, search, and pagination to SQL for large catalogues
- **Persistent Cart** — sync the cart to the backend so items survive logout and device changes
- **Admin Sales Dashboard** — revenue charts, top-selling products, and low-stock alerts
- **Coupon and Discount Codes** — apply promo codes at checkout with backend validation
